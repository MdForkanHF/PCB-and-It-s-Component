# PCB and It's Component

Working on PCB boards, checking the circuit connections, and soldering the components to make everything fit and run properly. I tested different modules like rechargeable batteries, solar cells, and small electronic parts. Spent time troubleshooting the circuit, fixing wrong joints, and making sure the board is ready to use. This gave me real practice with PCB layouts, soldering tools, and handling components step by step.
